          <div class="content-section">
            <p>Multilingualism is the lifeblood of every multicultural society. Tamil Nadu, shaped by its inclusive linguistic ethos, recognises the richness of its knowledge systems and cultural practices—many sustained through the intergenerational transmission of tribal languages. Each of these languages is a distinct repository of knowledge, encoding ecological wisdom, lived experience, and cultural expression. Recognising this, the Government of Tamil Nadu has taken up the mantle of responsibility. Language is not merely a tool of communication; it is a chronicle of memories and meaning.</p>

            <p>According to UNESCO's 2010 Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, over 40% of the world's 7,000 indigenous and tribal languages are endangered. India is home to many such languages, with several found within Tamil Nadu. In response to this alarming trend, the Government of Tamil Nadu has launched the Tholkudi Scheme, aimed at documenting the linguistic resources of the state's tribal communities. As part of this initiative, the Tholkudi Digital Repository has been established as a committed effort to preserve the digital records of the linguistic and cultural heritage of Tamil Nadu's indigenous communities and to facilitate their transmission to future generations.</p>

            <p>In response to global concerns, Tamil Nadu launched the Tholkudi Scheme to digitally preserve the linguistic heritage of its tribal communities. In 2024, the Hon'ble Finance Minister Thangam Thennarasu announced a landmark initiative inspired by the state's ancient civilisational ethos. The journey began with a national seminar in Chennai (27–28 September 2024), bringing together scholars, activists, and tribal representatives. This led to the selection of six documentation projects focusing on five tribal languages: Toda, Irular, Narikuravar, Kani, and Kurumba.</p>

            <p>The Tholkudi Digital Repository is part of a pioneering initiative by the Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, dedicated to preserving, revitalising, and celebrating the languages and cultural heritage of the state's tribal communities. Its primary mission is the long-term preservation of digital records of these languages, ensuring they remain accessible for future generations.</p>

            <p>The repository supports documentation teams in creating high-quality digital records in open, preservation-friendly formats. It serves as a platform for the ethical archiving, community-led curation, and dissemination of linguistic and cultural resources, enabling both academic research and community-led revitalisation efforts.</p>

            <h3>Core Objectives</h3>
            <p>The Tholkudi Digital Repository serves five core objectives to enable sustainable and ethical linguistic documentation:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Support Linguistic Documentation</strong> – Train teams and archive data using standardised, open formats.</li>
              <li><strong>Safeguard Cultural Knowledge</strong> – Digitally preserve traditional practices and oral knowledge.</li>
              <li><strong>Enable Digital Access</strong> – Build an open, multilingual archive driven by community participation.</li>
              <li><strong>Align with Global Standards</strong> – Contribute to the International Decade of Indigenous Languages and foster global academic partnerships.</li>
              <li><strong>Empower Communities</strong> – Centre tribal voices in knowledge creation and intergenerational transmission.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The Los Pinos Declaration [Chapoltepek] (2020), the outcome document of the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL2019), provides a roadmap for action during the Decade, emphasising the principle "Nothing for us without us." It calls for Indigenous communities to be central to decision-making, consultation, and planning. It also highlights key priorities such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Promoting Indigenous languages in education, health, and public life.</li>
              <li>Using digital technologies and media for language empowerment.</li>
              <li>Safeguarding cultural and linguistic heritage as living traditions.</li>
              <li>Ensuring inclusive, long-term action through global partnerships.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Building on national initiatives like the Central Institute of Indian Languages' Scheme for Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages (SPPEL) and the programs introduced under the 12th Five-Year Plan, Tamil Nadu's Tholkudi Scheme marks a significant step forward. It embeds language preservation within the framework of tribal welfare policy, treating linguistic dignity not as an isolated concern but as integral to cultural identity and community empowerment. By institutionalising this approach, the state reaffirms that safeguarding Indigenous languages is fundamental to securing equitable development and cultural justice for its tribal communities.</p>

            <p>The Tholkudi Digital Repository emerged from the national seminar held in Chennai in September 2024, uniting tribal elders, civil society actors, and academic experts. The projects selected exemplify a collaborative approach, placing Indigenous communities at the centre of documentation. The repository puts into practice the CARE Principles—Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics—ensuring that tribal communities retain agency over how their languages and traditions are archived, accessed, and reused.</p>

            <p>Tholkudi is more than a repository; it is a living cultural commons. It documents not just words, but worldviews: the Kwasrm couplets of the Toda that encode clan and landscape histories, Irula medicinal practices grounded in ecological knowledge, Kurumba visual art as a mode of storytelling, and Kanikaran's Satru Pattu songs that reflect ritual continuity. Tholkudi is a site for intergenerational learning, digital storytelling, and curriculum development; anchored in community voices and guided by global Indigenous rights frameworks.</p>

            <p>By embodying the principles of the Los Pinos Declaration, the Tholkudi scheme, along with its digital repository, stands as a model for localising international commitments. It affirms Tamil Nadu's leadership in preserving cultural and linguistic diversity and envisions a future where every language, however small, is treated as a world in itself.</p>
